The first notebook in a series of three and the accompanying data is complete.

## Planned Development

The current dataset is being expanded to simulate:

- Revenue and gross profit per product
- Cost-to-Serve modeling
- Forecasting logic
- Warehouse utilization

This version will enable deeper analysis of trade-offs in supply chain planning.
