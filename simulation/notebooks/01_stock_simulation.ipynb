    "#### Missed orders\n",
    "\n",
    "In terms of missed orders, Just-in-Time Deliveries clearly outperform Weekly Deliveries for Class A goods which tend to have a high and consistent demand. Frequent targeted restocking ensures that inventory levels are adequate for demand, reducing the number of stockouts.\n",
    "\n",
    "In Class B, JIT performs better albeit by a smaller margin. This shows that the benefits of JIT depend on the predicatability and consistency of the demand.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, it is the opposite for Class C goods. Due to their more sporadic demand, Class C goods benefit more from weekly top-ups. This allows a small amount of buffer stock to absorb any sudden, unexpected demand. JIT deliveries may struggle to keep up without the buffer stock.\n",
    "\n",
    "These patterns show that no one replenishment strategy is the best, and the right strategy should be picked depending on the demand profile of the product. This supports the adoptation of a **hybrid strategy** where the replenishment method is specific to the product class. In this case, Class A best fits JIT and Class C weekly deliveries. As an intermediary class, both strategies perform similarily for Class B, however JIT has a small advantage. The correct strategy for this class may be on a product by product basis.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Inventory level\n",
    "\n",
    "One of the clear advantages of JIT deliveries is the ability to maintain a leaner inventory, thereby reducing storage costs.\n",
    "\n",
    "Inventory utilization tends to lower under JIT compared to weekly deliveries except for Class A products, where both strategies are comparable due to high levels of turnover and replenishment. However, this comes at the expense of missed orders, particularly in Class C. In these cases, the cost of lost revenue likely outweighs the storage savings, especially when demand is irregular. This highlights the balance needed between minimizing held inventory and ensuring product availability, and supports the implementation of a hybrid delivery strategy to optimize overall efficiency.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Number of orders\n",
    "\n",
    "Unexpectedly, there are more orders under a weekly strategy than under a JIT strategy. This may seem counter-inuitive, but the total number orders are not necessarily the same as the total number of deliveries. JIT orders are event driven and are triggered when the stock of a given item dips below a certain reorder point. On the other hand, weekly deliveries are time driven and occur on a set schedule. This means we may see numerous smaller deliveries spread out throughout the week under a JIT system, and larger consolidated deliveries happening at a set schedule under a weekly based one. We will examine this more closely in the warehouse analytics notebook."

    "\n",
    "The effectiveness of JIT deliveries is highly dependent on having a short lead time. A responsive supply chain is essential for ensuring that shipments arrive just before inventory is depleted, effectively minimizing both holding costs and the risk of stock outs.\n",
    "\n",
    "Short lead times also benefit any scheduled deliveries that rely on forecasting (such as the seven-day moving average as in the simulation). In this case, a shorter lead time reduces the lag between when the forecast is made and when the shipment actually arrives, ensuring that replenishment is aligned with the current demand. \n",
